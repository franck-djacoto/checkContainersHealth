# CHECK CONTAINERS HEALTH
    This simple project check if containers deployed on certains url respond well and are not in a state like
    **Gateway time out** or are not returning a 404 error for example. If an abnormal behavior is 
    returned by a certain containers, then a mail is sent to some people who can fix this. 

# WHY THIS PROJECT  ?
    I decided to code this simple program to solve a problem that we (my classroom mates and I) encountered during 
    our end of school year project. We developped a workflow devops containing many containers which sometimes go on a 
    **Gateway time out** . To avoid checking containers state every time  I decided to ask my 
    program to do that for me and send an email alert to me when it detect a unexpected behavior.
